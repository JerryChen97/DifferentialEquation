# DifferentialEquation
This is a repo for the homework 2 of computational physics

## Introduction
In this module we will make use of finite difference method to solve the scalar wave equation in 1+1 dimensions:
$$\partial_t^2 u + c^2 \partial_x^2 u = 0$$
with default boundary condition
$$ u(0, t) = u(1, t) = 0 $$
